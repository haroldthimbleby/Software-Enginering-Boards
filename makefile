# makefile 
# Harold Thimbleby, 2022. harold@thimbleby.net
#
# entries of the form:
#
#     target-name : latex documentation
#
# are automatically summarized by make help, make help-brief and make (with no parameters)
#
# basically, a grep scans this makefile for these lines, then either edits the lines into 
# Latex table rows, or uses awk to remove all the Latex details so it can be presented
# to the user as simple ASCII text
#
# Common to both uses, make make raw.table.data does the basic grep to extract the lines
# then 
#     make latex.tabular.data > generated.make-help.tex saves it as Latex
#     make help-brief converts it to basic ASCII
#
