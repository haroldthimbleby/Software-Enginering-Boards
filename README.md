All data is defined and stored in human-readable JSON format in the file `data.js`

`data.js` also includes a JavaScript program that checks the JSON data, analyses it and generates various files.

If you just want all the data in various formats, please run

    node data.js

this will give you

        allData.csv - for accessing data in Excel and many other apps
        flagData.nb - for accessing data in Mathematica notebook
        data-check.html - a summary of papers and DOIs with any error messages (eg missing data), for easy review in a browser
    ...plus a few tex files with names paper-seb-generated*.tex for including data in Latex files

All the Latex data is summarised in the PDF file summarise.pdf

If you edit the JSON data, then you'll need to typeset summarise.tex again, as follows, to get the summaries updated:

     % make latex summarise.tex

***

If you have access to the full data, code and latex files, then there is a makefile that will do everything for you.

If you want PDFs or other material, please use make, as follows:

Provide a more detailed summary of what you can do
        
        % make make clean
Make clean PDFs, with no highlighting
        
        % make data
Generate all files and analyses from the JSON data in data.js
        
        % make tidyup
Remove all files that can be regenerated by make, except the main PDFs and data files
        
        % make reallytidyup
